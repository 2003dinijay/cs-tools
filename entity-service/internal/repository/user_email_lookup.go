// userByEmailJoin returns a LEFT JOIN that resolves emailExpr (a free-text
// created_by / user_email column) to at most one "user" row, exposed as
// alias with id, name, first_name and last_name.
//
// "user".email is not unique (only user_name is), and migrated records leave
// several rows per address, so a plain email join fans one source row out
// into one result row per match. The single match is chosen
// deterministically: active first, then most recently created, then lowest id.
func userByEmailJoin(alias, emailExpr string) string {
	return `LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
				SELECT u2.id, u2.name, u2.first_name, u2.last_name
				FROM "user" u2
				WHERE LOWER(u2.email) = LOWER(` + emailExpr + `)
				ORDER BY u2.is_active DESC NULLS LAST, u2.created_on DESC, u2.id
				LIMIT 1
